            <h2>Implementation Process</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Setting Up the Microphone Array :</strong>The first step in implementing the voice command feature is setting up the Sipeed MAIX R6+1 Microphone Array. The array is connected to the Raspberry Pi via the I2S interface, which includes
                    the following pins:
                    <ul>
                        <li> BCM 18 (PIN 12) - I2S Data (SD)</li>
                        <li> BCM 19 (PIN 35) - I2S Data Out (SDO)</li>
                        <li> BCM 20 (PIN 38) - I2S Data In (SDI)</li>
                        <li> BCM 21 (PIN 40) - I2S Clock (SCK)</li>
                        <li> 3.3V (PIN 1 or 17) - Power</li>
                        <li> GND (PIN 6, 9, 14, 20, 25, 30, 34, or 39) - Ground</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Configuring Audio Input :</strong>Once the microphone array is connected, the audio input needs to be configured. This involves installing the necessary drivers and configuring the audio settings on the Raspberry Pi to recognize
                    the microphone array as the primary audio input device.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Speech Recognition:</strong>To enable the robot to understand voice commands, we use the Google Speech-to-Text API. This involves recording the audio input from the microphone array, sending it to the Google Speech-to-Text service,
                    and receiving the transcribed text.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Recording Audio: </em>The audio is recorded using Python libraries such as pyaudio or speech_recognition.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Sending to API: </em>The recorded audio is sent to the Google Speech-to-Text API for transcription.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Receiving Text: </em>The API returns the transcribed text, which is then processed by the robot.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing</strong>The transcribed text is processed using Dialogflow to understand the intent behind the command. Dialogflow uses machine learning models to interpret the text and determine the appropriate response
                    or action.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Intent Detection: </em> Dialogflow identifies the intent of the command (e.g., “move forward”, “play music”).
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Entity Extraction: </em> Relevant entities (e.g., directions, actions) are extracted from the command.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Response Generation: </em>: Based on the detected intent and entities, Dialogflow generates a response or determines the action to be taken.

                    </li>

                </ul>
                <li><strong>Text-to-Speech: </strong>The robot uses the Google Text-to-Speech API to convert the response text into spoken language, providing verbal feedback to the user.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Generating Speech: </em> The response text is sent to the Google Text-to-Speech API, which returns an audio file.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Playing Audio: </em>The audio file is played through the speaker using Python libraries such as pygame or pyaudio.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Controlling Servo Motors: </strong>The robot’s movements are controlled using the Adafruit ServoKit library, which allows precise control of the servo motors based on the voice commands.
                </li>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>Initializing Servos: </em>The servo motors are initialized and connected to the appropriate GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi.
                    </li>
                    <li><em>Executing Commands: </em>Based on the processed voice commands, the servos are moved to the specified positions to perform actions such as raising an arm, turning the head, or walking.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </ol>

            <h2>Example Workflow</h2>
            <p>Here’s an example workflow illustrating the entire process:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>User Command</strong>: The user says, “Raise your right arm.</li>
                <li><strong>Audio Capture</strong>: The microphone array captures the audio input.</li>
                <li><strong>Speech Recognition</strong>: The audio is sent to the Google Speech-to-Text API, which returns the text: “Raise your right arm.</li>
                <li><strong>NLP Processing</strong>: Dialogflow processes the text and identifies the intent as “raise_arm” with the entity “right”.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Action Determination</strong>: The robot determines that the right arm servo motor needs to be moved to a specific position.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Servo Control</strong>: The Adafruit ServoKit library moves the right arm servo motor to the specified position.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Verbal Response</strong>: The Google Text-to-Speech API generates a response such as, “Raising my right arm.” This response is played through the speaker.
